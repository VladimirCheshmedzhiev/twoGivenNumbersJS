# twoGivenNumbersJS
Two integers n and k are given as input. This is a function that generates and prints the following sequence:
• The first element is 1.
• Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements.
• The length of the sequence is n elements.
The input comes as two number arguments. The first element represents the number n, and the second – the
number k.
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

The 2nd element (1) is the sum of the 3 elements before it, but there is only 1, so we take that. The third element is
the sum of the first 2 (1 and 1), and the 4th – the sum of 1, 1, and 2. The 5th element is the sum of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
(1, 2, and 4) and so on
